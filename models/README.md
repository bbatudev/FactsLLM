# Models Directory

This directory is reserved for model weights and adapters.

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the actual model files are **NOT** included in the repository.

## Required Models
You should place the following models here:

*   `base_model/` (Llama 3 base model)
*   `adapters/` (Unsloth fine-tuned adapters)

See the main `README.md` for setup instructions.
